    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <h4>Your team will</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>give a 30 second elevator pitch of your app to the audience and jurors (with one slide displayed behind you)</li>
                        <li>discuss and demonstrate your app in the subsequent poster session</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Pitch: Share problem & insight w/ everyone</h4>
                    <p>First, decide what features of your prototype, process, and research you want to communicate. What is the unique <i>point of view</i> that your design expresses? This is not a marketing spiel. It's about communicating a conceptual insight: what is your clear and novel value proposition? Do users know what they're there for, what they can do, and why your design hits a user need better that existing alternatives?</p>
                    <p>Consider the two visual deliverables you are creating, the slide and your poster, and how their content should differ. Your poster (and demo) should convey your design decisions, iterations, and what you learned from users. Take the core concepts and communicate them rather than explaining every detail. Your pitch should boil your work down to its essence. The slide is a high-level look to entice people to come and learn about your project, and it should show a screen (or two) of the user interface that you worked so hard to create.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for your slide and pitch by thinking about how you want to introduce your prototype for the first time. You have thirty seconds, and most of the audience has never seen your application before. How can you provide a high-level understanding of what your application does, or what needs it addresses? Find the "hook" that will interest people and persuade them to find your poster later on. Imagine you are trying to impress a new potential investor on a happenstance elevator ride. We recommend scripting your presentation and practicing it many times until it is smooth. We will have a timer running, and any presentation that goes over 30 seconds will be cut off.</p>
                    <p>The show opens with your pitches to give you a chance to share your work with all your fellow students, staff, and visitors. Make sure to share your key design insight.</p>

                    <h4>Poster & Demo</h4>
                    <p>How you are going to explain your prototype to people? Will you hand your mobile Web application to visitors to try, or will you walk them through a demo? Why did you make that decision? What are you going to say to them? What part of your design do you want to emphasize? Keep in mind that attendees don't have all the background and insight into your application. Present them with the user need first, show your solution, and explain why your work is unique. Your poster should stand on its own without explanation. There will be many people there and you will not be able to engage every single person who will look at your poster.</p>
                    <p>Finally, prepare a 1-minute demo of your prototype. Keep it short, while showing off all the features of your application. When jurors and visitors come to your poster, your quick demo should inspire them to pick up the phone and continue to play around with your app. It is important to have a demo rehearsed. There will be many people there and it is important to come across as prepared and knowledgeable to your visitors.</p>
                    <p>Each poster will be visited by two critics (staff and/or jurors).</p>
                    <p>Your poster will be kept by the staff for archival and display purposes. </p>
