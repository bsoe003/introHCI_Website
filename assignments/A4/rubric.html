                                <ol>
                                    <li>Analysis and relations to Nielsen's heuristics aren't overly vague or tough to understand.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Evaluation applies heuristics to partner's prototype in a useful, organized way.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Clearly grounded in Nielsen's heuristics. This evaluation could be used in the lecture about Nielsen's heuristics.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">Volume of Feedback
                                <ol start = 4>
                                    <li>Feedback seems individually generated. Work must not be blank, illegible, copied from other group members, or all generated as a group (rather than indivdually).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Criterion 4 met. At least 10 violations found, employing at least 6 of the 10 heuristics. The evaluator wasn't trying to be "nice" or "hold back" certain feedback. The evaluator was familiar enough with the heuristics to identify violations readily.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Criterion 4 met. At least 15 violations found, employing at least 8 of the 10 heuristics. You really couldn't ask for more. Clearly the evaluator "showed no mercy."
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">Quality of Feedback
                                <ol start = 7>
                                    <li>Feedback was not obvious (you could have come up with it without really going through the HE process) or vague (the designers might not be sure what the problem you're referring to is).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Feedback draws a useful comparison between the two prototypes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Insightful, widely varied feedback that compared the two prototypes. This feedback will give the designers a solid grasp of the advantages and drawbacks of each design, and help them decide which design or which features to implement.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">Severity Ratings
                                <ol start = 10>
                                    <li>Each violation has a severity rating identified.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The violations have appropriate severity ratings. As a result, the group that made the prototypes can make a good prioritized list of problems to address in their designs.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>

                                <ol start = 12>
                                    <li>The conclusions reached by the evaluators as a group was not just a rehash of all the individual evaluations, but were more insightful than the aggregation of all the individual evaluations.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Potential solutions to major usability problems were brainstormed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Potential solutions to major usability problems were creative and insightful, not something that the group that made the prototypes could have figured out for themselves.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>

                                <ol start = 15>
                                    <li>Link to an HTML home screen provided. Image-based mock-ups (e.g.,&nbsp;Photoshop) receive no credit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>HTML home screen appears to have most of its content.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Home screen content is very thoroughly developed. It does not need to be pretty or highly stylized.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>

                                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                    <li>Multiple parts of the feedback were innovative and interesting. The student has obviously spent a lot of time and energy applying Nielsen's Heuristics in a clever manner.
                                    </li>
